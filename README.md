# To-Do-List-New
Built a To-Do List Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage daily tasks efficiently.

 Features include adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed, with real-time UI updates and local storage support to save tasks.
 
 Focused on responsive design and clean user experience.
 
 This project helped strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and front-end logic.
